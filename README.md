# Space-Ships
The project is about simple ship battle in an open space. By the Queen, the King, lets roll.

The game repserents a step-by-step game, where the player has a fleet of five space ships that have different stats.
Each ship has energy points which he spends for moving, one cell up, down, left or right. Also it can shoot enemy ships
but it requires some energy. Also in the middle of arena the asteroids are present and the can destroy the ship easily.

Good luck in the battle.
